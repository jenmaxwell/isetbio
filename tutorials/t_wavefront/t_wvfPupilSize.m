function t_wvfPupilSize
%
% Explore the effect of changing the pupil size in the calculation.
%
% We load the Thibos wavefront data collected at some pupil diameter.
% There are a few options.  We set these data into the zernicke
% coefficients.
%
% We then set the calculated pupil size and compute the expected
% pointspread function.  That function changes as the pupil diameter gets
% smaller.
